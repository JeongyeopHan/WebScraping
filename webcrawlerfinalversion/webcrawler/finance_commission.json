(a)  This code is enacted as a part of the state's continuing statutory revision program, begun by the Texas Legislative Council in 1963 as directed by the legislature in the law codified as Section323.007, Government Code.  The program contemplates a topic-by-topic revision of the state's general and permanent statute law without substantive change. (b)  Consistent with the objectives of the statutory revision program, the purpose of this code is to make the law encompassed by this code more accessible and understandable by: (1)  rearranging the statutes into a more logical order; (2)  employing a format and numbering system designed to facilitate citation of the law and to accommodate future expansion of the law; (3)  eliminating repealed, duplicative, unconstitutional, expired, executed, and other ineffective provisions;  and (4)  restating the law in modern American English to the greatest extent possible.

If the period is extended, the bank may acquire or establish a subsidiary, or may perform new activities in an existing subsidiary, only on prior written approval of the banking commissioner. (f)  A subsidiary of a state bank is subject to regulation by the banking commissioner to the extent provided by Chapter11or12, this subtitle, or rules adopted under this subtitle.

(b)  For a deposit account that is opened with a bank by one or more persons expressly as a trustee for one or more other named persons under or purporting to be under a written trust agreement, the trustee may provide the bank with a certificate of trust to evidence the trust relationship.  The certificate must be an affidavit of the trustee and must include the effective date of the trust, the name of the trustee, the name of or method for choosing successor trustees, the name and address of each beneficiary, the authority granted to the trustee, the disposition of the account on the death of the trustee or the survivor of two or more trustees, other information required by the bank, and an indemnification of the bank.  The bank may accept and administer the account, subject to SubchapterB, Chapter111, and Chapters112and113, Estates Code, in accordance with the certificate of trust without requiring a copy of the trust agreement.  The bank is not liable for administering the account as provided by the certificate of trust, even if the certificate of trust is contrary to the terms of the trust agreement, unless the bank has actual knowledge of the terms of the trust agreement. (c)  On the death of the trustee or of the survivor of two or more trustees, the bank may pay all or part of the withdrawal value of the account with interest as provided by the certificate of trust.  If the trustee did not deliver a certificate of trust, the bank's right to treat the account as owned by a trustee ceases on the death of the trustee.  On the death of the trustee or of the survivor of two or more trustees, the bank, unless the certificate of trust provides otherwise, shall pay the withdrawal value of the account with interest in equal shares to the persons who survived the trustee, are named as beneficiaries in the certificate of trust, and can be located by the bank from its own records.  If there is not a certificate of trust, payment of the withdrawal value and interest shall be made as provided by SubchapterB, Chapter111, and Chapters112and113, Estates Code.  Any payment made under this section for all or part of the withdrawal value and interest discharges any liability of the bank to the extent of the payment.  The bank may pay all or part of the withdrawal value and interest in the manner provided by this section, regardless of whether it has knowledge of a competing claim, unless the bank receives actual knowledge that payment has been restrained by court order.

If the depositor defaults in the repayment or satisfaction of the obligation, the bank, without notice to or consent of the depositor, may set off or cancel on its books all or part of the accounts owned by the depositor and apply the value of the accounts in payment of and to the extent of the obligation.

An obligation is not required to be accelerated or matured for a default to authorize set-off of the depositor's obligation against the defaulted payment.

(c)  For purposes of this section, a state bank affiliate does not include a company in which ownership or membership is limited to individuals and conditioned by law on the existence and maintenance of professional licensing. (d)  To promote regulatory efficiency, if, in the preceding 24 months, a third-party service provider or affiliate has been examined by a federal or state financial services regulatory agency or by a member agency of the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council, or its successor agency, the banking commissioner may accept the results of that examination instead of conducting the banking commissioner's own examination of the third-party service provider or affiliate.

With respect to a third-party service provider's refusal to submit to examination, the banking commissioner may notify all state banks of the refusal and warn that continued use of the third-party service provider may constitute an unsafe and unsound banking practice.

Section 16(c), Article XVI, Texas Constitution, grants to state banks created by virtue of the power vested in the legislature by Section 16(a) of that article the same rights and privileges that are or may be granted to national banks domiciled in this state.  The legislature finds that Section 16(c) of that article does not restrict the legislature's power to provide a system of state regulation under Section 16(a) of that article that differs from the regulatory scheme imposed on national banks under federal law or prevent the finance commission, acting under authority granted by the legislature for the purpose of implementing this subtitle, from adopting rules that differ from federal statutes and regulations or that reasonably regulate the method or manner by which a state bank exercises its rights and privileges if the rules are adopted after due consideration of the factors listed in Section31.003(b).

The banking commissioner may prohibit the bank from performing the activity only if the banking commissioner finds that: (1)  a national bank domiciled in this state does not possess the specific right or privilege to perform the activity the bank seeks to perform;  or (2)  the performance of the activity by the bank would adversely affect the safety and soundness of the bank. (c)  The banking commissioner may extend the 30-day period under Subsection (b) if the banking commissioner determines that the bank's letter raises issues requiring additional information or additional time for analysis.  If the 30-day period is extended, the bank may perform the proposed activity only on prior written approval by the banking commissioner, except that the banking commissioner must approve or prohibit the proposed activity or convene a hearing under Section31.201not later than the 60th day after the date the banking commissioner receives the bank's letter.  If a hearing is convened, the banking commissioner must approve or prohibit the proposed activity not later than the 30th day after the date the hearing is completed.

The commissioner may extend the application period for good cause. (g)  A determination by the commissioner under Subsection (e) that an application is complete and is accepted for processing is not an assessment of the substance of the application or of the sufficiency of the information provided.  That determination means only that the application, on its face, appears to include all of the items and address all of the matters that are required under Subsection (b). (h)  When an application is filed and considered complete under Subsection (e), the commissioner shall investigate the financial condition and responsibility, financial and business experience, character, and general fitness of the person or group of persons acting in concert seeking to acquire control.

(a)  In accordance with rules adopted under this subtitle, a foreign bank licensed to establish and maintain a Texas state branch or agency shall at all times satisfy the ratio of branch or agency assets to liabilities determined by the commissioner, in the commissioner's sole discretion, to be necessary or desirable with respect to the foreign bank.  The type of assets to be held in this state are specified by Subsection (b) and the type of liabilities to be included in the ratio are specified by Subsection (c). (b)  Assets to be held in this state for the purpose of satisfying the ratio of assets to liabilities: (1)  include: (A)  currency, bonds, notes, debentures, drafts, bills of exchange, or other evidences of indebtedness, including loan participation agreements or certificates; (B)  other obligations payable in the United States or in United States funds or, with the prior approval of the commissioner, in funds freely convertible into United States funds;  and (C)  other assets the commissioner permits or as may be specified by rule;  and (2)  exclude obligations of a person for money borrowed to the extent that the total of the obligations of the person exceeds 10 percent of total assets considered for purposes of this section. (c)  Liabilities included for purposes of calculating the ratio of assets to liabilities: (1)  include all liabilities of the foreign bank appearing in the books, accounts, or records of its Texas state branch or agency, including acceptances;  and (2)  exclude amounts due and other liabilities to other offices, agencies, branches, and wholly owned subsidiaries of the foreign bank, and other liabilities the commissioner determines.  The existence of a nominal number of directors' shares outstanding does not cause a subsidiary to be considered less than wholly owned. (d)  Subject to rules adopted under this subtitle, the commissioner, in the commissioner's sole discretion, may vary the ratio of assets to liabilities required by this section for a foreign bank as may be necessary or desirable to reflect differences among Texas branches or Texas agencies because of: (1)  the financial condition of Texas branch or agency offices of the foreign bank; (2)  the financial condition of branch or agency offices of the foreign bank located in other states; (3)  the general economic conditions prevalent in the home country of the foreign bank;  or (4)  the financial condition of the foreign bank itself, including: (A)  the financial condition of its branches and agencies located in other countries; (B)  the financial condition of its affiliated bank and nonbank subsidiaries in the United States;  and (C)  the financial condition of the foreign bank on a worldwide consolidated basis or in its home country. (e)  For purposes of this section, assets must be valued at the lower of principal amount or market value.  The commissioner may determine the value of a non-marketable security, loan, or other asset or obligation held or owed to the foreign bank or its Texas state branch or agency in this state.  If the commissioner cannot determine the value of an non-marketable asset, the asset must be excluded from the ratio computation. (f)  The commissioner may require a foreign bank to deposit the assets required to be held in this state pursuant to this section with specific banks in this state designated by the commissioner if, because of the existence or the potential occurrence of unusual and extraordinary circumstances, the commissioner considers it necessary or desirable for the maintenance of a sound financial condition, the protection of depositors, creditors, and the public interest in this state, and the maintenance of public confidence in the business of a Texas state branch or agency.

(a)  If the commissioner finds that any of the factors set forth in Section204.116are true with respect to a foreign bank licensed to establish and maintain a Texas state branch or agency, the commissioner may by order immediately take possession of the property and business of the foreign bank in this state if that action is necessary or desirable for the protection of the interests of the depositors and creditors of the foreign bank's business in this state or for the protection of the public.  The commissioner shall retain possession until the foreign bank resumes business in this state or is finally liquidated, except that the commissioner may permit the foreign bank to resume business in this state on conditions the commissioner requires.  An order issued under this section shall be served on the foreign bank in the manner required by Section204.117(a)(2). (b)  As soon as practicable after taking possession of the property and business of a foreign bank pursuant to Subsection (a), the commissioner shall initiate a receivership proceeding by filing a copy of the order issued under this section in a district court in Travis County to be governed by Chapter36as if the foreign bank were a Texas state bank, except as otherwise provided by this section.  Notwithstanding the priorities established by Chapter36, the depositors and creditors of the Texas state branch or agency, arising out of transactions with and recorded on the books of the Texas state branch or agency, have an absolute preference and priority over the creditors of the foreign bank's offices located outside this state. (c)  An action initiated that seeks to directly or indirectly affect the assets of the Texas state branch or agency is considered to be an intervention in the receivership proceeding.  Venue for an action instituted to effect, contest, or otherwise intervene in the liquidation of a Texas state branch or agency is in Travis County, except that on motion filed and served concurrently with or before the filing of the answer, the court may, on a finding of good cause, transfer the action to the county of the Texas state branch or agency location. (d)  The foreign bank may contest the commissioner's actions as provided by this subsection.  On or before the 10th day after the date the commissioner has taken possession of the property and business of a foreign bank pursuant to Subsection (a), the foreign bank, acting through a majority of its directors, may intervene in the action filed by the banking commissioner to challenge the commissioner's closing of the foreign bank's Texas state branch or agency and to enjoin the commissioner or other receiver from liquidating its assets.  The court may issue an ex parte order restraining the commissioner or other receiver from liquidating the foreign bank's assets pending a hearing on the injunction.  The commissioner or other receiver shall comply with the restraining order but may petition the court for permission to liquidate an asset as necessary to prevent its loss or diminution pending the outcome of the injunction.  The commissioner or other receiver may not be required to post bond.  The court shall hear this action as quickly as possible and shall give it priority over other business.  The foreign bank or the commissioner or other receiver may appeal the court's judgment as in other civil cases, except that the commissioner or other receiver shall retain all seized foreign bank assets pending a final appellate court order even if the commissioner does not prevail in the trial court.  If the commissioner prevails in the trial court, liquidation of the state trust company may proceed unless the trial court or appellate court orders otherwise.  If liquidation is enjoined or stayed pending appeal, the trial court retains jurisdiction to permit liquidation of an asset as necessary to prevent its loss or diminution pending the outcome of the appeal. (e)  After the commissioner or other receiver has completed the liquidation of the property and business of a foreign bank, the commissioner or other receiver shall transfer any remaining assets to the foreign bank in accordance with the court's orders, except that: (1)  if the foreign bank has an office in another state of the United States that is in liquidation and the assets of the office appear to be insufficient to pay in full the creditors of that office, the court shall order the commissioner or other receiver to transfer to the liquidator of that office the amount of the remaining assets that appears to be necessary to cover the insufficiency;  or (2)  if the foreign bank has two or more such offices in liquidation and the amount of remaining assets is less than the aggregate amount of insufficiencies with respect to the offices, the court shall order the commissioner or other receiver to distribute the remaining assets among the liquidators of the offices in the manner the court finds equitable.

{"text": "Sec. 307.051.  COLLATERAL PROTECTION INSURANCE.  (a)  Collateral protection insurance is insurance coverage that: (1)  is purchased by a creditor after the date of a credit agreement; (2)  provides monetary protection against loss of or damage to the collateral or against liability arising out of the ownership or use of the collateral;  and (3)  is purchased according to the terms of a credit agreement as a result of a debtor's failure to provide evidence of insurance or failure to obtain or maintain insurance covering the collateral, with the costs of the collateral protection insurance, including interest and any other charges incurred by the creditor in connection with the placement of collateral protection insurance, payable by a debtor. (b)  Collateral protection insurance includes insurance coverage that is purchased to protect: (1)  only the interest of the creditor;  or (2)  both the interest of the creditor and some or all of the interest of a debtor. (c)  The term of a collateral protection insurance policy may be: (1)  not greater than 12 months;  or (2)  the remaining term of the credit transaction if the remaining term is less than or equal to 24 months. (d)  The effective date of coverage for collateral protection insurance may be earlier than the date of issuance of the policy.  The effective date may not be earlier than the date the collateral became uninsured. (e)  A premium for collateral protection insurance covering collateral other than real property may not be based on an amount that exceeds the actual amount of unpaid indebtedness of the debtor as of the effective date of the policy.  This condition applies without regard to whether the coverage under the policy limits the insurer's liability to: (1)  the amount of unpaid debt; (2)  the cash value of the collateral;  or (3)  the cost of repair of the collateral. (e-1)  With respect to collateral protection insurance covering real property, a creditor, at the creditor's option, may obtain insurance that will cover either the replacement cost of improvements or the amount of unpaid indebtedness, subject to policy limits.  The debtor shall be obligated to reimburse the creditor for the premium, finance charges, and any other charges incurred by the creditor in connection with the placement of the insurance.  The creditor may use the previous evidence of insurance coverage furnished by the debtor to determine the sufficient level of replacement cost coverage to be provided. (f)  Collateral protection insurance does not include insurance coverage that: (1)  is purchased by the creditor for which the debtor is not charged; (2)  is purchased at the inception of a credit transaction in which the debtor is a party or to which the debtor agrees, whether or not costs are included in a payment plan under the credit transaction; (3)  is maintained by the creditor for the protection of collateral that comes into the possession or control of the creditor through foreclosure, repossession, or a similar event; (4)  is credit insurance, mortgage protection insurance, insurance issued to cover the life or health of the debtor, or any other insurance maintained to cover the inability or failure of the debtor to make payment under the credit agreement; (5)  is title insurance; (6)  is flood insurance required to be placed by creditors under Section 102, National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C.

(a)  A loan contract under this chapter that is a regular transaction and is not secured by real property may provide for an interest charge on the cash advance that does not exceed the amount of add-on interest equal to the amount computed for the full term of the contract at an add-on interest amount equal to: (1)  $18 for each $100 per year on the part of the cash advance that is less than or equal to the amount computed under SubchapterC, Chapter341, using the reference base amount of $300;  and (2)  $8 for each $100 per year on the part of the cash advance that is more than the amount computed for Subdivision (1) but less than or equal to an amount computed under SubchapterC, Chapter341, using the reference base amount of $2,500. (b)  For the purpose of Subsection (a): (1)  when the loan is made an interest charge may be computed for the full term of the loan contract; (2)  if the period before the first installment due date includes a part of a month that is longer than 15 days, that portion of a month may be considered a full month;  and (3)  if a loan contract provides for precomputed interest, the amount of the loan is the total of: (A)  the cash advance;  and (B)  the amount of precomputed interest. (c)  A loan contract under this chapter that is an irregular transaction and is not secured by real property may provide for an interest charge, using any method or formula, that does not exceed the amount that, having due regard for the schedule of installment payments, would produce the same effective return as allowed under this section if the loan were payable in equal successive monthly installments beginning one month from the date of the contract. (d)  A loan contract under this chapter that is not secured by real property may provide for a rate or amount of interest computed using the true daily earnings method or the scheduled installment earnings method that does not exceed the alternative interest rate as computed under SubchapterA, Chapter303.  Interest may accrue on the principal balance and amounts added to principal after the date of the loan contract from time to time unpaid at the rate provided for by the contract until the date of payment in full or demand for payment in full. (e)  A loan contract under this chapter that is not secured by real property may provide for a rate or amount of interest computed using the true daily earnings method or the scheduled installment earnings method that does not exceed: (1)  30 percent a year on that part of the cash advance that is less than or equal to the amount computed under SubchapterC, Chapter341, using the reference base amount of $500; (2)  24 percent a year on that part of the cash advance that is more than the amount computed for Subdivision (1) but less than or equal to an amount computed under SubchapterC, Chapter341, using the reference base amount of $1,050;  and (3)  18 percent a year on that part of the cash advance that is more than the amount computed for Subdivision (2) but less than or equal to an amount computed under SubchapterC, Chapter341, using the reference base amount of $2,500.

A lender refinancing the loan may not contract for or receive an administrative fee for the loan more than once in any 180-day period, except that if the loan has an interest charge authorized by Subsection (e) the lender may not contract for or receive the administrative fee more than once in any 365-day period.  One dollar of each administrative fee may be deposited with the comptroller for use in carrying out the finance commission's responsibilities under Section11.3055. (g)  The finance commission by rule may prescribe a reasonable maximum amount of an administrative fee for a loan contract under this subchapter that is greater than the maximum amount authorized by this section for the amount of the loan.

(b)  A retail seller and prospective retail buyer may enter into a conditional delivery agreement. (c)  A conditional delivery agreement is: (1)  an enforceable contract; and (2)  void on the execution of a retail installment contract between the parties to the conditional delivery agreement for the sale of the commercial vehicle that is the subject of the conditional delivery agreement. (d)  A conditional delivery agreement may only confer rights consistent with this section and may not confer any legal or equitable rights of ownership, including ownership of the commercial vehicle that is the subject of the conditional delivery agreement. (e)  A conditional delivery agreement may not exceed a term of 15 days. (f)  If a prospective retail buyer tenders to a retail seller a trade-in motor vehicle in connection with a conditional delivery agreement: (1)  the parties must agree on the value of the trade-in motor vehicle; (2)  the conditional delivery agreement must contain the agreed value of the trade-in motor vehicle described by Subdivision (1); and (3)  the retail seller must use reasonable care to conserve the trade-in motor vehicle while the vehicle is in the retail seller's possession. (g)  If the parties to a conditional delivery agreement do not subsequently enter into a retail installment contract for the sale of the commercial vehicle that is the subject of the conditional delivery agreement, the retail seller shall, not later than the seventh day after termination of the conditional delivery agreement: (1)  deliver to the prospective retail buyer any trade-in motor vehicle that the prospective retail buyer tendered in connection with the conditional delivery agreement in the same or substantially the same condition as it was at the time of execution of the agreement and shall return any down payment or other consideration received from the prospective retail buyer in connection with the agreement; or (2)  if the trade-in motor vehicle cannot be returned in the same or substantially the same condition as it was at the time of execution of the conditional delivery agreement, deliver to the prospective retail buyer a sum of money equal to the agreed value of the trade-in motor vehicle as described by Subsection (f) and shall return any down payment or other consideration described by Subdivision (1). (h)  Any money that a retail seller is obligated to provide a prospective retail buyer under Subsection (g) must be tendered at the same time that the trade-in motor vehicle is delivered for return to the prospective retail buyer or when the trade-in motor vehicle would have been delivered if the vehicle was damaged or could not be returned. (i)  If a prospective retail buyer returns a commercial vehicle under a conditional delivery agreement at the request of the retail seller, the retail seller, notwithstanding the period prescribed by Subsection (g), must return the trade-in vehicle at the same time that the commercial vehicle under the conditional delivery agreement is returned by the prospective retail buyer. (j)  The prospective retail buyer shall return the commercial vehicle received under the conditional delivery agreement in the same or substantially the same condition as it was at the time of the execution of the conditional delivery agreement. (k)  An amount paid or required to be paid by the retail seller under Subsection (g) is subject to review by the commissioner.  If the commissioner determines that the retail seller in fact owes the prospective retail buyer a certain amount under Subsection (g), the commissioner may order the retail seller to pay the amount to the prospective retail buyer.  If the trade-in motor vehicle is not returned by the retail seller in accordance with this section and the retail seller does not pay the prospective retail buyer an amount equal to the agreed value of the trade-in motor vehicle within the period prescribed by this section, the commissioner may assess an administrative penalty against the retail seller in an amount that is reasonable in relation to the value of the trade-in motor vehicle.  The commissioner shall provide notice to the retail seller and the prospective retail buyer of the commissioner's determination under this subsection. (l)  Not later than the 30th day after the date the parties receive notice of the commissioner's determination under Subsection (k), the retail seller or prospective retail buyer may file with the commissioner an appeal of the commissioner's determination requesting a time and place for a hearing before a hearings officer designated by the commissioner.  A hearing under this subsection is governed by Chapter2001, Government Code.  After the hearing, based on the findings of fact, conclusions of law, and recommendations of the hearings officer, the commissioner shall enter a final order. (m)  A person who files an appeal under Subsection (l) is required to pay a deposit to secure the payment of the costs of the hearing in a reasonable amount as determined by the commissioner, unless the person cannot afford to pay the deposit and files an affidavit to that effect with the hearings officer in the form and content prescribed by finance commission rule.  The entire deposit must be refunded to the person if the person prevails at the hearing.  If the person does not prevail, any portion of the deposit in excess of the costs of the hearing assessed against the person is refundable. (n)  Notice of the commissioner's final order under Subsection (l), given to the person in accordance with Chapter2001, Government Code, must include a statement of the person's right to judicial review of the order.

(b)  For the purposes of this section, fees or charges include both voluntary contributions and any other fees charged to or collected from a consumer or on behalf of the consumer. (c)  A provider may not impose fees or other charges on a consumer or receive payment for debt management services until the consumer has entered into a debt management service agreement with the provider that complies with Section394.209. (d)  If a consumer enters into a debt management service agreement with a provider, the provider may not impose a fee or other charge for debt counseling, education services, or similar services except as otherwise authorized by this section.  The commissioner may authorize a provider to charge a fee based on the nature and extent of the counseling, education services, or other similar services furnished by the provider. (e)  Subsections (f)-(j) apply subject to an adjustment made under Section394.2101.
